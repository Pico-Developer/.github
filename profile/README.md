# PICO Developer
Welcome to the PICO Developer GitHub repository! This is PICO's offcial repository for open-source samples covering the use of PICO SDK features, including rendering, MR, interaction, spatial audio, platform services, motion tracker, and more. These samples can help you quickly get started on app development for PICO XR headsets with Unity, Unreal, Native, and WebXR. We will continue to maintain and update the samples for a better development experience.

## SDKs

* **PICO Unity Integration SDK** (recommended for building apps with full XR features): https://github.com/Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-Integration-SDK.git
* **PICO OpenXR SDK** (recommended for cross-platform development with OpenXR): https://github.com/Pico-Developer/PICO-Unity-OpenXR-SDK
* **PICO Unreal Integration SDK**: https://github.com/Pico-Developer/PICO-Unreal-Integration-SDK

Unity SDKs can be installed via the Unity Package Manager, click the + button and choose "[add package from git url](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html)"

To get older versions of Unity and Unreal SDKs and samples, you can check out the _branches_ in the respective repo. For more information on PICO SDK and documentation, visit [PICO Developer Platform](https://developer.picoxr.com/).
